For a change to this variable to take effect the cache needs to be rebuilt

  "SETTING THIS TO t IS POTENTIALLY UNSAFE.

If non-nil company-(fish)-shell will try and find a doc-string by running
`arg --help'if `man arg' did not produce any valid results. This is not
completely safe since company-shell does not and can not know whether it is
safe to run a command in this fashion. Some applications may simply ignore or
misinterpret the command flag, with unpredictable results. Usually this just
means that instead of any actual documentation you'll see an error message
telling you the program doesn't know what to do with the --help arg or that
it was started with invalid input. In rare cases a program may simple ignore
the --help arg and directly spawn a GUI like xfce4-notes-settings does.

To mitigate any such issues company-shell will run the --help attempt on a timer
of 1 second. This is more than enough to fetch the doc output if it is available,
but will quickly close any process that may accidentally have been spawned. In
addition the command will run in a restricted shell (found via
$(which sh) --restricted) to further avoid any unwanted side effects.

Despite these precautions company-shell will nonetheless need to sometimes run
completely unknown binaries, which is why this option is turned off by default.
You need to consciously enable it in the understanding that you do this AT
YOUR OWN RISK."
