;; Backend for company mode to complete binaries found on your $PATH
;; and fish shell functions.

;;; Code:

(require 'company)
(require 'dash)
(require 'cl-lib)

(defvar company-shell--cache nil
  "Cache of all possible $PATH completions. Automatically built when nil. Invoke `company-shell-rebuild-cache' to rebuild manually.")

(defvar company-shell--fish-cache nil
  "Cache of all possible fish shell function completions. Automatically built when nil. Invoke `company-shell-rebuild-cache' to rebuild manually.")

(defvar company-shell-delete-duplicates t
  "If non-nil the list of completions will be purged of duplicates. Duplicates in this context means any two
string-equal entries, regardless where they have been found. This would prevent a completion candidate
appearing twice because it is found in both /usr/bin/ and /usr/local/bin.

For a change to this variable to take effect the cache needs to be rebuilt via `company-shell-rebuild-cache'.")

(defvar company-shell-modes '(sh-mode fish-mode shell-mode eshell-mode)
  "List of major modes where `company-shell' will be providing completions if it is part of `company-backends'.
All modes not on this list will be ignored. Set value to nil to enable company-shell regardless of current major-mode.")

(defvar company-fish-shell-modes '(fish-mode shell-mode)
  "List of major modes where `company-fish-shell' will be providing completions if it is part of `company-backends'.
All modes not on this list will be ignored. Set value to nil to enable company-fish-shell regardless of current major-mode.")

(defvar company-shell-use-help-arg nil
  "SETTING THIS TO t IS POTENTIALLY UNSAFE.

If non-nil company-(fish)-shell will try and find a doc-string by running `arg --help'
if `man arg' did not produce any valid results. This is not completely safe since
company-shell does not and can not know whether it is safe to run a command in this
fashion. Some applications may simply ignore or misinterpret the command flag, with
unpredictable results. Usually this just means that instead of any actual documentation
you'll see an error message telling you the program doesn't know what to do with the
--help arg or that it was started with invalid input. In rare cases a program may simple
ignore the --help arg and directly spawn a GUI like xfce4-notes-settings does.

To mitigate any such issues company-shell will run the --help attempt on a timer of
1 second. This is more than enough to fetch the doc output if it is available, but will
quickly close any process that may accidentally have been spawned. In addition the command
will run in a restricted shell (via $(which sh) --restricted) to further avoid any unwanted
side effects.

Despite these precautions company-shell will nonetheless need to sometimes run completely unknown
binaries, which is why this option is turned off by default. You need to consciously enable
it in the understanding that you do this AT YOUR OWN RISK.")
